1.Problem Statement :
Students of VIT Bhopal often face difficulties while travelling to Bhopal City or Bhopal Railway Station, which is nearly 70 km away from the campus.
There is no single source that provides clear and reliable information about available transportation options such as autos, cabs, charted buses, timings, fares, or emergency contacts.
This usually leads to confusion, delay, and inconvenience—especially for new students or those travelling for the first time.
This project aims to create a simple Python-based system that collects and displays all transportation details in one place, making travel planning easier and faster for students.

2. Scope of the Project:
The scope of this project includes:
Providing information about autos, cabs, and buses available from VIT Bhopal to Bhopal.
Displaying driver contact numbers, approximate fares, and available vehicle types.
Showing charted bus timings and their fare structure.
Including an easy search feature to find transportation quickly.
Adding an emergency contact module (security, police, ambulance).
Providing a clean and simple menu-based Python interface.
Organizing the project into multiple modules for easy maintenance.
The project does not include real-time tracking, live booking, or online payment.

3. Target Users:
The main users of this system are:
VIT Bhopal students who travel to Bhopal City or the railway station.
Newly admitted students unfamiliar with travel options.
Hostellers who frequently need transport to the city.
Anyone on campus needing reliable transport details quickly.

4. High-Level Features:
The transportation system provides the following major features:

1. View Transportation Options:
Autos with fare details and driver contacts
Cabs like Swift, Ertiga, Omni, Van, etc.
Charted buses with timings and fares

2. Search Function:
Search any vehicle type by entering a keyword
Helps students find transport faster


3. Emergency Contact List:
Important emergency numbers
Quick access for urgent situations


4. Simple Interactive Menu:
User chooses an option
Program displays corresponding information
Ends with a “Thank you, Have a Safe Journey” message


5. Modular Code Structure:
Organized into separate Python files
Easy to update or expand in the future
